					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Engineers: they find solutions for solving problems. Artists: they find creative approaches for presenting a concept. Engineers and artists were both the same through out history; just like Leonardo da Vinci, whose inventions solved problems of his age and even his future, in the most surprising ways no one had ever imagined. In the modern times, engineering and arts are torn apart, treated like they are two opposite poles of a magnet, when they are really the faces of the same coin.</p>
					<p>I am both and engineer and an artist. I embrace the merging of the hemisphers of the brain, and engineer the perfect solutions because they are also the most creative ones.</p>
